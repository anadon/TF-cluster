Examples are provided that will do the following:
- read CEL/CDF files and expression/genotyping CHP files.  
- read CYCHP files generated by our Chromosome Analysis Suite.
- write either an expression file (with signal estimates only such as we do with PLIER or RMA) or genotyping results (using SNP6 columns).
The Java samples use the pure java implementation of the SDK.
