<td valign="top">The File Parsers SDK is a toolkit for providing parsing 
capabilities with the Affymetrix BAR, BPMAP, CDF, CEL, CHP, DAT, DTT 1.1 XML, 
EXP, GRC, MSK, and PSI files. The C++ code in this SDK are written 
without MS Windows dependencies so as to be compatible with a variety of 
machines and operating systems.</td></tr>

<span class="header2">CONSTANTS</span></th></tr>
	<tr>
<td valign="top">There are several constants that may need to be defined to 
enable compilation and execution on specific operating systems. These are :<br>
<br>
IS_BIG_ENDIAN - Define this value if the machine represents its data in big 
endian format.<br>
<br>
_INCLUDE_UNISTD_HEADER_ - Define this value if the UNISTD.H header file is used 
by the C++ compiler on your machine.<p>WIN32 - Define this value if using the 
MSVC++.NET compiler.<p>_USE_MEM_MAPPING_ - This value is used to indicate if 
memory mapping should be used. This constant is not set, by default, within the source code. 
You must define this macro in the compilation arguments to enable memory 
mapping. Memory mapping has only been implemented for BAR, BPMAP, CDF and CEL file reading.<br>

Release 1 of the SDK provides:<ul>
	<li>Data access capabilities for CEL, CHP, CDF, BAR 
and BPMAP files.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;This version was developed and tested on a Windows XP system 
using MSVC++.NET 2003 and RedHat Linux 8 using G++ version 3.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Release 2 of 
the SDK provided the following changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tested on Windows XP using MSVC++.NET 2003 and Apple Macintosh G5 System X 
	and Cygwin (under Windows XP) systems using G++ 3.3.</li>
	<li>Memory mapping techniques were implemented for CEL, CDF, BAR and BPMAP 
	file reading for faster file access. This change in access required a 
	change in several interfaces. The memory mapping feature use WIN32 APIs to 
	map the file for the Windows platform and POSIX APIs for non-Windows 
	platforms.</li>
	<li>Access to control probe sets stored in CDF files. A new class within the 
	affxcdf namespace was added to provide the X/Y coordinates of the probes for 
	the controls (corner checkerboards, central cross, etc.)</li>
	<li>Support for BAR version 2 file has been added.</li>
	<li>Changed the use of LONG types to INT for extended system compatibility.</li>
	<li>Many of the interfaces have changed for memory mapping support. Most 
	significant is the
<span class="content">
	<b>CELFileEntryType</b> object. This object no longer stores X/Y coordinate, 
	mask and outlier flag. This data is accessible via added functions to the <b>
	CCELFileData</b> class.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="content">Release 3 of the SDK provides the following changes:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Tested on Windows XP using MSVC++.NET 2003 and Apple Macintosh G5 System 
	X systems using G++ 3.3.</li>
	<li>Added CHP file parsing of resequencing and tag arrays.</li>
	<li>Support for BPMAP version 2 and 3.</li>
	<li>Changed interfaces to CEL reader to support the Affymetrix GeneChip<sup><font face="Times New Roman">®</font></sup> 
	Exon Array Computational Tool (ExACT).</li>
	<li>Added parsers for EXP, DAT, DTT 1.1 XML, GRC, MSK and PSI files.</li>

		<p>The SDK uses the XERCES library for parsing XML files. Source code for

			<li>DTT 1.1 XML MAGE Files</li>

		<p>The XERCES library is available at: <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/">
