				<h1>Affymetrix® Fusion SDK - Release 1.1.2  (June 2011)</h1>

		  	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The Fusion SDK provides ANSI C++ source code for parsing data files generated and managed by the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console software and the older GCOS 1.x software.  Using the Fusion SDK provides backwards and forward flexibility by providing the ability to parse both types of data files.   Newsletters and recorded WebTalks about the Command Console software are available on the Affymetrix <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/partners_programs/programs/developer/index.affx">DevNet web site </a>.</p>  

<p>The SDK was developed using the ANSI C++ language and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++ on 32 and 64 bit Windows 7 systems, G++ 4.4.4 compiler on an Apple OS X 10.6 system and G++ 4.4.4 compiler on 32 and 64 bit Fedora linux systems. The Java code in the Fusion SDK requires JRE 1.6 or above. </p>

<p>The documentation provided and source code in the Fusion SDK contains references to the project code named "Calvin". This code name is used to refer to the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console software.</p>

<p>The source code in the Fusion SDK is licensed under the <a href="fusion_sdk_license.html"> GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).</a>
	

<h2>RELEASE NOTES</h2>

<p><b>Version 1.1.2 Updates (June 2011)</b></p>

    <ul>
	<li>This release of our Fusion SDK provides support for an enhanced version of the CYCHP file format.  You can find detailed 
 	    information about the format in our <a href="./file_formats/cychp.html">file formats document</a> included in this package</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A data group has been added to the CYCHP files generated from the CytoScan HD array to house genotyping data generated by brlmm-p-plus analysis.</li> 
			<li>For CYCHP files generated from CytoScan HD arrays, the ASignal and BSignal values stored in the Algorithm data group have been moved to the new genotyping data group.  
			These metrics will continue to be housed in the Algorithm table for those CYCHP files generated from the 2.7M array</li> 
			<li>The Segments data group is optional and will be included in the CYCHP file if segments are report by an analysis.</li> 
			<li>The Summary data set in the Chromosome data group now includes a column for the MedianSignal value.</li>
		</ul>  
	<li>The C++ and Java versions of the Fusion SDK have been enhanced to seamlessly parse both the CytoScan HD and the 2.7M arrays.  Also, functionality 
	to write CYCHP files for the CytoScan HD array has been added to the C++ version of the SDK.</li>
	<li>The C++ and Java versions of the read_cytov2 sample application have been updated to provide example code for reading the new genotyping table.  
	Also provided is sample code for reading the updated Algorithm table.</li>
	<li>Upgrades to the C++ SDK</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The primary platform for the released binary and library files is now 64 bit. All compiled binaries and libraries included in the SDK packages are for 64-bit platforms.
			The source code included in the Fusion SDK can be used to build 32-bit versions of the binaries and libraries. We continue to provide support for 32-bit platforms in this release</li>
			<li>The Visual Studio projects for building libraries, sample programs and converter applications have been updated to include configuration settings for 64 bit compilations. The settings for
			compiling the projects for the 32 bit platform have been retained,</li> 
			<li>The warning level in the Visual Studio projects files generating libraries has been changed from 3 to 0.</li>
			<li>A new <a href="./parser_examples/cpp/write_chp">example program</a> to write expression and genotyping results is included.</li>
		 </ul>	
    </ul>		 
	

<p><b>Version 1.1.1 Updates (March 2011)</b></p>

    <ul>

			<li>The project settings of the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 project files used to create libraries encapsulating code for parsing and writing Affymetrix files have been changed to enhance performance. Compiled 32 bit versions of the libraries used in our sample applications can be found in the <a href="libraries_and_tools">./libraries_and_tools/libraries</a> folder</li>

<h2>COMPILING THE CODE</h2>

<p>There are several macros that may need to be defined, using the "-D" compiler switch, to enable compilation and execution on specific operating systems. These are:</p>

<h2>3RD PARTY TOOLS</h2>


<p><b>XERCES</b></p>

<p>The SDK uses the XERCES library for parsing XML files. Source code for this library is not included as part of the Fusion SDK.  Current Command Console formatted XML files are:</p>

    <ul>
		<li>Array Files</li>
		<li>Templates Files</li>
		<li>DTT 1.1 XML MAGE Files</li>
	</ul>

<p>The XERCES library is available at: <a
  href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/ </a>. You must download and build this library to use the XML parsing objects of the Fusion SDK. The Fusion SDK was tested with XERCES version 3.0.</p>

<p>XERCES must be installed at the same level as "affy" directory. The folder name must be "xerces". The name and relative location to the affy directory is assumed within each Visual Studio project.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

    <ul>
	<li>/development/./...</li>
    <li>/development/xerces</li>
	</ul>

<p><b>CPPUNIT</b></p>

<p>Previous versions of the Fusion SDK (version 1 through 1.0.12) included a set of unit test cases to test each class within the SDK.   This version of the Fusion SDK does not include unit test cases.  The information below is retained for those interested in running the test cases included in earlier versions.</p>

<p class="indent"><ul>The unit tests included with earlier versions of the Fusion SDK were developed using the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/"> CPPUNIT </a> Framework version 1.10.2. Test case source and Visual Studio Projects were located in the "./calvin_files/*/test" folders. Each Visual Studio Project (located in the test directory - e.g. ./calvin_files/array/test) will compile, build and execute the test cases. The test cases will run giving a "." for each test when it completes. If an "F" is displayed instead of a ".", then that test case failed. When all the test cases were attempted and failed or passed, those that failed will be indicated with the source line and file where the error occurred. The number of passed and failed test cases will be indicated as well. If all test cases pass, then an "OK" is indicated along with the test case count. The test cases may also be performed inside the development environment in debug mode. Stepping through code during debug is also supported (Visual Studio).</ul></p>

<p class="indent"><ul>Test data included in the earlier versions of the Fusion SDK could be found in the data folder one level up from the test folders - e.g. ./calvin_files/parsers/data. An additional test data folder is provided for larger files and that is in common to both GCOS 1.x File SDK and Fusion. This test data is located in the "./TestDataFiles" folder</ul></p>

<p class="indent"><ul>CPPUNIT must be installed at the same level as "affy" directory. The folder name must be "cppunit". The name and relative location to the affy directory is assumed within each Visual Studio project.</ul></p>

	<p><ul>Example:</p>	
	 <ul>
	  <li>/development/./...</li>
      <li>/development/cppunit</li>
	</ul>
	</ul>
<h2>INTERFACE DOCUMENTATION</h2>

<p>Interface documentation for C++ source code was generated using the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a> (version 1.4.3) documentation system. This system generates on-line documentation (in HTML) from the set of source code files. You may regenerate the documentation using the Doxygen tool using different parameters to customize the contents. In future releases, these additional formats will be provided by way of Doxygen configuration files. One for each type of format supported by Doxygen.</p>

    <ul>
		<li>LaTex</li>
		<li>RTF</li>
		<li>MAN</li>
		<li>XML</li>
	</ul>

<p>The documents are available in the "./interface_docs/" directory. Click <a href="interface_docs/index.html">here</a> to view the interface documentation (HTML format).</p>

<p>Documentation for the Java source code was generated with JavaDoc, a document generator from Sun Microsystems that generates API documentation in HTML format from Java source code. The documents are available in the "./java/AffxFusion/dist/javadoc/" directory. Click <a href="java/AffxFusion/dist/javadoc/index.html">here</a> to view the Java documentation (HTML format).</p>
